# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project applies modern concepts to create a robust back-end server optimized for handling HTTP requests and routing. It features secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring protected routes and session management. Error handling is meticulously designed using custom error classes, global error handlers, and effective strategies for both synchronous and asynchronous operations. Additionally, middleware functions enhance code organization and reusability, while environment variables and configuration files support scalability and security across various environments.
